# react-tic-tac-toe
Tutorial project for React

### Precaution:
Be careful when cloning this repo! I had to implement the tutorial project on a skeletal base provided by my bootcamp teacher. It has been recycled for a while which is why some packages in the lock file will have some vulnerable packages. 
I would not use this repo as a skeleton for your projects.

### About this project:
This is a tutorial project here: https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html
